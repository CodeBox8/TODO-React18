      <p>
        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that
        allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. It is built
        on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling the execution of
        JavaScript outside of a browser. This makes it possible to use
        JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development,
        streamlining development and improving efficiency.
