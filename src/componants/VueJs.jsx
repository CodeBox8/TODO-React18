        Vue.js is a progressive, open-source JavaScript framework used for
        building user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). It is
        designed to be flexible, easy to integrate with other projects, and
        offers a simple, declarative approach to building interactive UIs.
        Vue.js focuses on the view layer and can be easily adopted
        incrementally, making it ideal for both small and large-scale
        applications.
